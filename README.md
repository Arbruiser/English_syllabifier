# English_syllabifier
Phonologically plausible English word syllabifier developed by me as final project for the "Computational Morphology" course at the University of Helsinki.   
  
To run it you need the .lexc and .xfst files as well as installed Lexc and XFST. The python file and the pronunciation dictionary were only necessary in production of the lexc file.
